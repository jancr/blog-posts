# Communism is Universal Preferable Behaviour

Stefan Molyneux is a right-wing darling who have "proven" the validity of UPB
(**U**niversal **P**referable **B**ehaviour), thus he has conquered the
is-ought gap of ethics.

## Everything is UPB

He uses UPB to "prove" all the tenets of libertarian ideology. Here is an
example:

"You can't simultaneously, want to steal and to be stolen from, Hench stealing
is UBP, something, something, property rights is UBP"

In that vein I would like to offer:

"You can't simultaneously want to be of above average wealth, and of below
average wealth, **BOOM!** communism is UPB, capitalism is not."

## Arguing for UPB is not UPB

If you want an philosopher to explain why Molyneux does not conquer the
is-ought gap then I can recommend [Rationality Rules: "Molyneux Humean
Disaster"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYLvbutgjKU) or [Their
debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obdW6p_pvA0)

One of the most annoying things about UPB is that Stefan literally argues that 
arguing against UPB "proves" UPB, here is the argument, from page 40 of
his book [Universally Preferable
Behaviour](http://cdn.media.freedomainradio.com/feed/books/UPB/Universally_Preferable_Behaviour_UPB_by_Stefan_Molyneux_PDF.pdf):

1. The proposition is: the concept “universally preferable behaviour” must be
   valid. 
2. Arguing against the validity of universally preferable behaviour
   demonstrates universally preferable behaviour. 
3. Therefore no argument against the validity of universally preferable
   behaviour can be valid.

I think the above argument is to complex, many people will see premise 1) as
begging the question. So I have created a new and improved version of the
argument, by tweaking the first premise:

1. Arguing for the validity of UPB demonstrates UPB
2. Arguing against the validity of UPB demonstrates UPB
3. Therefore UPB is valid

I doubt that proponents of UPB will deny my new premise 1) :), and we know
they already buy argument 2) This argument is so simple, that proving 3) from
from 1) and 2) is only has two steps in predicate logic (next section). Where the
original premise can not even be rendered in predicate logic! You might be able
to render it in first order logic, but that is beyond me :)

The above argument however commits the [Proving too much
fallacy](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/13/proving-too-much/). So either
premise 1 or premise 2 is wrong... So maybe arguing for UBP does not
demonstrates Universal Preferable Behavior!

## Formal Proof of my UPB argument

Let:

* $A$ be "arguing for UPB"
* $\neg{}A$ be "arguing against UPB"
* $U$ be UPB

|   | Argument                | Reason                    | 
|---|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | $A\Rightarrow{}U$       | Premise 1                 |
| 2 | $\neg{}A\Rightarrow{}U$ | Premise 2                 |
| 3 | $\neg{}A\lor{}U$	      | From 1                    |
| 4 | $A\lor{}U$              | From 2                    |
| 5 | $U$                     | Conclusion (From 1 and 2) |
