# The tail of the forager and the druid

My ancestor was a druid, who healed the sick and shared the tales of
[Epona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epona), she had a good life, when she
died, she reminisced about hear youth being taught at Ynys Mon, by the other
druids

My ancestor was a forager, her keen senses kept the children bellies full at
day and, the wolfs at bay at night. When she died, she reminisced about the
summer where she discovered more clamps that the tribe could eat.

…

Today you may be the druid, pondering the structure of the universe and healing
the sick, you do not need to reminisce about what you learnt in your youth,
because your curiosity can be fulfilled via journal articles, lectures and experiments.

Today you may be the forager, your keen senses confused by the dazzling lights
of the city, disconnected from nature, working hard at the assembly line, you
suffered in your youth, always confused, always scared, your senses to keen, your
mind to vigilant, oh, thank the druids for your medication, dulling your senses and mind, 
the pride of your ancestors, finally you can be a ‘productive’ member of society.

Society owes little to the druid, for her life has been enriched by modernity,
but the forager, much preferring 40 years of meaningful bliss to 70 years of
drudgery, she has been robbed of her potential, she never had a change to
bloom, in times of old she could retreat to the mountains like the other
barbarians, but alas, even mountains have been enclosed by modernity.

The story was inspired by the by the [slate star codex post
burdens](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/16/burdens/), and the song [Ins
Mona - Eluveiti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iijKLHCQw5o)
